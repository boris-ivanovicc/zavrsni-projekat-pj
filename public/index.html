                Welcome to <b>the Flock of Quills</b>—a place where words are bundled up to capture what's often hard to say out loud.<br>
                We see poetry as the reflection of the soul—something evoking the deepest emotions, yet meant to be shared. Think of us as shepherds guiding your thoughts,
                feelings and memories into verses.

            <b>Why Poetry?</b><br>
            Poetry is timeless. It's emotion slowed down, shaped carefully into lines. When a single sentence can echo louder than pages, that’s poetry—a 
            bridge between thought and feeling. In a noisy world, poems make space to feel something real.
            Whether it’s a personal gift, a tribute, or just a moment of inspiration, our poems are tailored to your voice.
        </p>

            <b>Who We Write For</b><br>
            We write for anyone who has something to say—or something they can’t quite say yet. 
            You don’t need to be poetic. You just need a thought, a reason, or a feeling. Whether it's for you or someone else, your story deserves to be heard.
        </p>

        <p class="align-left">
            <b>What You Can Expect</b><br>
            Within a few days of your request, you’ll receive a poem—tailored to your note and tone. We aim for simplicity and beauty.
            You can edit your request if you need, and if you're unsure where to start, we’ll gently guide you through.
